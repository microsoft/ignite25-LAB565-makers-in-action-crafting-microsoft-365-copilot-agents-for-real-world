# LAB565 - Makers in action: crafting Microsoft 365 Copilot Agents for real-world

Welcome to the lab! In this session, you'll warm up by learning how to consume an MCP Server and how to use Azure AI Search as a knowledge source for an agent. Both objectives will be achieved while creating agents in Microsoft Copilot Studio full.

The lab consists of 7 exercises designed to guide you step-by-step through these key concepts. Enjoy your learning journey!

Throughout this lab, you'll gain hands-on experience with Microsoft Copilot Studio, building practical agents that leverage real-world data and advanced AI capabilities. By the end, you'll understand how to connect your agents to external knowledge sources, integrate Azure AI Search, and utilize MCP Server endpoints to enhance your solutions.

Each exercise is crafted to help you develop new skills, reinforce your understanding, and prepare you to create intelligent agents for Microsoft 365 scenarios. Don't hesitate to experiment and exploreâ€”this is your opportunity to innovate and learn in a supportive environment.
